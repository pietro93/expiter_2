The <b>city of Milan</b>, with 1,371,498 residents, is the second-most popolous city and <b>industrial, commercial and financial capital of Italy</b>.

 Milan is a global center for fashion, design, and business. It is home to prestigious fashion houses, luxury brands, and renowned design studios.

 The city hosts major international fashion events, including Milan Fashion Week.

 Milan's financial district houses Italy's stock exchange and important financial institutions. The city is also rich in artistic and cultural heritage, with iconic landmarks such as the Milan Cathedral (Duomo di Milano), the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, and the Sforza Castle.

 Additionally, Milan is known for its thriving nightlife, diverse culinary scene, and vibrant street markets.<br><br><a href="https://expiter.com/comuni/province-of-milano/">The larger Milano metropolitan area comprises <b>133 towns</b> (comuni)</a> and covers an area of 1.575 km<sup>2</sup>. The <b>population density is 2,071 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup></b>, making it somewhat densely populated. The male to female ratio is 1.00:1.07.<br><br>
<p><b>Milan</b> (Italian: <i>Milano</i>; Milanese: <i>Milan)</i> is financially the most important city in Italy, and home to the Borsa Italiana stock exchange. It is the second most populous city proper in the country, but sits at the centre of Italy's largest urban and metropolitan area. While not considered as beautiful as some Italian cities, having been greatly destroyed by Second World War bomb raids, the city has rebuilt itself into a thriving cosmopolitan business capital. In essence, for a tourist, what makes Milan interesting compared to other places is that the city is truly more about the lifestyle of enjoying worldly pleasures: a paradise for shopping, football, opera, and nightlife. Milan remains the marketplace for Italian fashion – fashion aficionados, supermodels and international paparazzi descend upon the city twice a year for its spring and autumn fairs.
</p><p>Milan is famous for its wealth of historical and modern sights - the Duomo, one of the biggest and grandest Gothic cathedrals in the world, La Scala, one of the best established opera houses in the world, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, a glamorous 19th-century arcaded shopping gallery, the Brera art gallery, with some of the finest artistic works in Europe, the Pirelli tower, a majestic example of 1960s modernist Italian architecture, the San Siro, a huge and famed stadium, or the Castello Sforzesco, a grand medieval castle. So, you have your fair share of old and new monuments. Plus, it contains one of the world's most famous paintings - Leonardo da Vinci's <i>The Last Supper</i>.
