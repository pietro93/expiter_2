                  Expiter is a tool aimed at helping those who live or are planning to move to Italy make more informed decisions. <b>We help expats and travellers access and digest information 
                  about the "best" places to live in Italy</b>. </br></br>
                  We collect and display data about different Italian cities and provinces, including but not limited to: climate data, cost of living, healthcare, transport, safety, nightlife and so on; 
                  with a special attention to feedback from expats, exchange students, and digital nomads.

                </label>
                <div class="answers">
                  We collect and combine data from different sources, such as the open-source yearly <a href='https://lab24.ilsole24ore.com/qualita-della-vita/'>Quality of Life Rankings from IlSole24Ore</a>, 
                  housing price indexes from <a href="https://www.immobiliare.it/">Immobiliare.it</a>, user reviews from <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/">TripAdvisor</a>, as well as our own surveys and feedback 
                  collected directly from expats and nomads in Italy.</br></br>
                  When creating our city rankings for Expiter, we weight our data in order to make feedback from expats and those who moved to Italy from other countries have a higher impact on our scores compared to data sourced from people who were born and raised in Italy. 
                </br></br>This means that our data more closely reflects the experience and feedback of expats in Italy compared to that of locals, and our results may be substantially different from those of the sources we partially rely on.

                    The information displayed on this website is sourced from different databases, research studies, surveys and user-generated (often subjective) content. Because of the nature of 
                    this data, <b>you should not deem it as 100% accurate</b>. The tool is updated regurarly as new data is collected, so that the information stays more up-to-date and increasingly accurate.

                    <div class="answers">
                        Italy is divided in 107 provinces (large metropolitan areas), which are generally named their largest city (<i>comune</i>). For instance: the province of Milano includes the city of Milan (the capital or "<i>capoluogo</i>" of the Province) 
                        as well as 133 smaller <i>comuni</i> nearby. Because of their proximity, these towns tend to share similar climate, economy, infrastructure and culture - although cost of living is often 
                        much lower the farther you are from the Province's capital.
                    </br></br>
                        For simplicity, we collect and display data about the province as a whole, which includes both its <i>capoluogo</i> and <i>comuni</i> nearby. In the future, we aim at providing more specific information about the most popular cities for both expats and nomads 
                        based on feedback from our community.

                            At present, expiter is 100% free to browse. We do not have a paid subscription plan and we do not charge for any product or service. We may earn from partnerships, display advertisement or affiliate commissions for 
                            external products and services offered by third parties. This is however at no additional cost to you as a user.
                        </br></br>
                            We currently have no plans to implement paid features in the near future. If you want to help expiter grow, please consider sharing it with your network and talk about it on social media.
